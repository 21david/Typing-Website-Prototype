# Typing Test Website

## Project Description
This is a web application that allows users to test their typing speed. Users type the words that appear on the screen for a set duration, and the application shows them their typing speed in "words per minute" (WPM) at the end.

## Features
- Typing speed test with customizable durations and difficulty levels
- Accurate and detailed WPM calculation
- Multiple language options
- Translation feature for language learners
- Responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile typing practice

## Instructions
1. Visit [https://21david.github.io/Typing-Website-Prototype](https://21david.github.io/Typing-Website-Prototype)
1. Optionally customize your test using the options in the top row:
    - **Difficulty Level:** Choose from easy, medium, hard, or expert.
    - **Duration:** Select the length of the test (e.g., 30 seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes).
    - **Language:** Pick the language for the website and test.
1. Start the test:
    - Begin typing the highlighted word to the best of your ability. The timer starts with your first keystroke.
    - When done typing a word, press space to move on to the next word.
    - If you misspell a word while typing it, the background will turn red and you have a chance to correct it. Capitalization matters.
    - After submitting a word, it will turn green if spelled correctly, or red if spelled incorrectly. 
    - If it is not responding, click on the text box labeled "Type the words here" or click "Restart" or refresh the page.
1. Review your results:
    - When the timer ends, your WPM and other statistics are displayed automatically.
    - Assuming easy mode, the average typing speed is between 30 - 50 WPM. A good goal for casual typers is 50 - 70 WPM, and 70 - 100 WPM for professional typers.
1. Restart or customize:
    - Click "Restart" or adjust the options to take a new test.
  
## Tips for Improving Typing Speed and Accuracy
1. **Use Proper Techniques:**
    - Place your left index finger on the letter F and the rest of your fingers on the keys to the left
        - [A] [S] [D] [**F**]
    - Place your right index finger on the letter J and the rest of your fingers on the keys to the right
        - [**J**] [K] [L] [;]
    - For the letters on the top row, use the finger that is closest to it. The same applies for the letters on the bottom row and the letters G and H. Use your thumbs for the space bar.
    - Practice touch typing, which means not looking down at the keyboard. This comes automatically with practice.
1. **Improve Posture:** Sit up straight and position your keyboard and monitor for comfort. Try to keep your hands symmetrically placed in front of you, not at an awkward angle.
1. **Focus on Accuracy First:** Prioritize accurate typing to build muscle memory, which will naturally increase your speed.
1. **Take Breaks:** Avoid fatigue by taking regular breaks and stretching your hands (at least every 20 minutes, for at least 20 seconds).
1. **Practice Regularly:** Dedicate daily or weekly time to typing practice.

By following these tips, you can significantly enhance your typing skills within days or weeks.
